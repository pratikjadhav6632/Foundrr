const aboutFoundrr = `ðŸ”¹ About Foundrr\n\nFoundrr is Indiaâ€™s first platform designed to help entrepreneurs find the right co-founder â€” not just someone with skills, but someone who shares the same vision, mindset, and drive to build.\n\nWe started Foundrr because we know the reality: building a startup alone is tough. Many great ideas never take off simply because founders couldnâ€™t find the right person to build with. Thatâ€™s where we come in.\n\nFoundrr lets you create a profile based on your strengths, goals, and what you're building. Whether you're a developer, marketer, product thinker, or hustler â€” you can match with others who complement your skillset and share your ambition. Itâ€™s not just about swiping through profiles; itâ€™s about meaningful discovery, smart filters, and real connections.\n\nOur mission is to make sure no founder builds alone. Weâ€™re building a space where Indiaâ€™s next generation of makers, dreamers, and doers come together to start up â€” faster and stronger.\n\nBecause at the core of every successful startupâ€¦ is the right team.\nAnd every founder deserves to find theirs.\n\nBuild bold. Build with Foundrr.`;
