Community Guidelines – Foundrr:
Effective Date:
Last Updated:
________________________________________
Introduction
At Foundrr, we are building more than just a platform — we are creating a trusted space for entrepreneurs, co-founders, and builders to connect, collaborate, and grow. To maintain a professional, respectful, and inclusive environment, every user must adhere to these Community Guidelines.
These guidelines define what is acceptable and what is not while using Foundrr. They apply to all areas of the platform, including profiles, bios, messages, interactions, posts, comments, and content submissions.
Violation of these guidelines may result in content removal, warnings, suspension, or permanent account termination, depending on the severity of the breach.
________________________________________
Respect and Professionalism
We expect every member of Foundrr to treat others with respect and courtesy. As a professional networking space, communication should reflect mutual regard, openness, and maturity.
Prohibited behavior includes but is not limited to:
• Harassment, bullying, or intimidation
• Hate speech, discriminatory language, or slurs
• Inappropriate jokes or remarks about gender, religion, caste, ethnicity, sexuality, or disability
• Personal attacks or malicious intent in interactions
All communication should focus on ideas, projects, and collaboration — not personal traits or unrelated opinions.
________________________________________
Authenticity and Truthfulness
Every profile on Foundrr should reflect a real person and their true background. Misrepresentation undermines trust and can be harmful to potential partnerships.
Please ensure:
• Your profile photo is your own and not generated, altered, or misleading

Any account found using false identity or credentials will be removed without notice.

You may not:
• Send unsolicited spam, promotions, or sales pitches

• Share inappropriate media or links
• Pressure users into responses or meetings
• Send repeated unwanted messages after being asked to stop
Foundrr reserves the right to monitor message behavior patterns (not content) for safety purposes.
________________________________________
Content Standards
Content includes anything you publish on the platform: bios, posts, idea descriptions, images, and any form of public or private communication.
Please ensure your content:
• Is original or properly credited
• Does not contain nudity, sexually explicit material, or obscene visuals
• Avoids misinformation, rumors, or exaggerated claims
• Is free from scams, fake investment claims, or get-rich schemes
• Does not promote violence or illegal activity
We have zero tolerance for content that promotes divisiveness, hostility, or exploitation.
________________________________________
Intellectual Property Respect
Do not upload or share content that you do not own or have rights to use. This includes images, graphics, text, or product ideas belonging to someone else.
If you believe someone is infringing your intellectual property, you may report it to us through the grievance redressal mechanism.
________________________________________
Reporting Violations
If you come across behavior or content that violates these guidelines, you can report it via:
• In-app report feature
• Email to support@foundrr.co with screenshots or profile details
All reports are reviewed confidentially and fairly. We take all violations seriously and aim to protect the integrity of the Foundrr community.
________________________________________
Enforcement and Consequences
Depending on the severity of the violation, actions may include:
• Content removal
• Temporary restrictions or warnings
• Account suspension
• Permanent ban from the platform
• Legal action if necessary
Repeated offenses or malicious intent will lead to stricter penalties without warning.
________________________________________
Final Thought
Foundrr is a platform built by founders, for founders. The community only thrives when there is trust, respect, and a shared code of conduct. These guidelines are not just rules — they are the foundation of our culture.
Let’s build something great together — responsibly, professionally, and respectfully.
